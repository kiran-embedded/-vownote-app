## 🏗️ Architecture & Performance

BizLedger is built on a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and testability.

### 🚀 Performance Highlights
- **Optimized Rendering**: Maintains **60 FPS** even with complex gradients and shimmer animations using `RepaintBoundary` and optimized `AnimatedBuilder` layers.
- **Tree Shaking**: Release builds utilize aggressive tree-shaking, reducing font assets by **~99%** (from 2MB to <15KB).
- **Smart Caching**: `SharedPreferences` and In-Memory caching strategies minimize disk I/O for frequent setting reads.
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports and lazy service initialization ensure rapid cold-start times (<1.2s).

### 🔒 Security Architecture
- **Native Integration**: Implements `FlutterFragmentActivity` to leverage Android's hardware-backed Biometric Prompt.
- **Session Security**: Uses **RAM-based Session Tracking** for authentication. Auth state is never written to disk, ensuring that every app kill/restart triggers a mandatory security check.
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: `AuthGate` intercepts app resume events to enforce lock screens instantly when returning from the background.
